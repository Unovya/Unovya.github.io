    <p class="txt">
        Hey! My name is Aiden. I was born in Ohio in 2007 and raised by my great-grandmother.<br>
        When I was 5 years old I was given a mobigo. I spent a lot of time playing those educational <br>
        games, and at one point, I started to wonder how it worked. As I got older that wonder continued<br>
        and changed into wanting to create things myself. From then, I told my family that I wanted to become <br>
        a computer programmer. As I got older I refined my goal to become a software engineer and a front end Dev <br>
        leading to now.
